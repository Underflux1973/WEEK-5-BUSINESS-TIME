  - **Message Containers**: Each board has a corresponding div to display messages specific to that board. Only one container is active at a time.

### 2. **CSS Styles (style.css)**

- **Notifications**: Provides user feedback through notifications for actions like successful submissions or deletions.

## Server Side Explanation

### 1. **Server Setup (`server.js`)**

- **Express Framework**: Uses Express to create a web server that handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them appropriately.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow requests from different origins, enabling the frontend to communicate with the backend.
- **Middleware**: Uses middleware like `express.json()` to parse incoming JSON request bodies.

### 2. **Database Connection**

- **PostgreSQL**: Establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg` library, allowing the server to query and manipulate data.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like the database connection string is stored in environment variables for security.

### 3. ** Endpoints**

- **GET `/data`**:
  - This endpoint retrieves messages for a specified board.
  - Validates that a board name is provided and queries the database to return the relevant messages in JSON format.
- **POST `/add-data`**:
  - Handles the submission of new messages.
  - Validates input data (name, location, message, board) before inserting it into the database.
  - Returns the newly created message as a response.
- **POST `/data/:id/like`**:
  - Increments the like count for a message identified by its ID.
  - Updates the database and returns the updated message data.
- **DELETE `/data/:id`**:
  - Deletes a specified message from the database based on its ID.
  - Returns a confirmation message upon successful deletion.

### 4. **Error Handling**

- **Input Validation**: Checks for missing fields in incoming requests and responds with appropriate error messages.

- **Centralized Error Handling Middleware**: Catches any unhandled errors in the application and logs them, providing a fallback response to the client.

### 5. **Logging**

- **Console Logging**: Logs errors to the console, aiding in debugging and understanding server behavior during execution.

## Summary

This web application consists of a structured client side that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction, and a robust server side built with Node.js and Express that handles data management through a PostgreSQL database. Together, they allow users to interact dynamically with the application, submitting, liking, and deleting messages in real-time while providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
